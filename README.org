* Docker and AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI (awsebcli)

Why?

- Why not
- You do not want to install awsebcli on your system
- Automate builds w/ Jenkins w/o affecting the jenkins envrionment

* Build docker image locally

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker build -t eb .
#+END_SRC

* Setup

There are 2 steps that are required to be performed:

- handling the AWS credentials
- handling the code

** Passing AWS credentials

The AWS credentials can be passed with the environment variables or via the config file.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker run -ti --rm -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro eb list
docker run -ti --rm -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY v ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro eb list
#+END_SRC


** Handling the app code

Let's assume that the app to be deployed is inside the src/ folder. We would mount the volume at operate
it.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker run -ti --rm --volume `pwd`/src:/aws/ --volume ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro eb init
docker run -ti --rm --volume `pwd`/src:/aws/ --volume ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro eb list
#+END_SRC
